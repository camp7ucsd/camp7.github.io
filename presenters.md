CAMP[6] will have both **talks** and **poster sessions** (not flash talks).

Long talks will each be **25 minutes long**, including **at least 5 minutes** of Q&A. This means the talk itself can last up to 20 minutes, but a speaker is free to give a shorter talk and leave more time for Q&A (e.g., 15 minute talk + 10 minutes Q&A).

Posters should be in portrait format, no larger than **48x36 inches**.
