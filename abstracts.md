## Submission Details
Abstracts conform to the typical format of the annual Human Sentence Processing Conference. Abstracts are limited to 1 page of text, with an optional second page containing figures, references, and example materials. Abstracts must be submitted in pdf format on letter page size (8.5" x 11") with 11pt Arial font and 1 inch margins. While the submission should be anonymous, in-text references and citations do not need to be anonymized.

Submissions reporting in-progress studies are invited, provided that:
* Data collection has commenced in some form and is expected to be completed (including data analysis) by the date of presentation; 
* Detailed information about the current state of data-collection is provided, including the intended sample size and how the data will be analyzed;
* Interpretation of possible outcomes with regard to the research question is clearly articulated.

Student and post-doc research will be prioritized over faculty authors, and junior faculty over more senior faculty for presentations. First authors must be **based at a university in California**.
